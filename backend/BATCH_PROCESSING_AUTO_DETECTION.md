# Batch Processing Auto-Detection Implementation

## Overview
The system now automatically detects whether to use single-file or multi-file (batch) processing based on the number of files selected, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (main_enhanced_v12.py)
- **Fixed indentation error** in the Google Drive upload section (lines 694-766)
- **Automatic single vs batch detection**: 
  - Single file: Processes normally with individual Google Drive upload
  - Multiple files: Initializes batch with `skip_individual_gdrive=True`, processes files in parallel, then finalizes with single combined Google Drive upload

### 2. Frontend Changes (PDFProcessorWorkflow_MultiFile.jsx)
- **Updated component title** to reflect automatic single/multi-file support
- **Clarified batch logic** with comments explaining when batch is used
- **Removed unused `combineResults` function** (replaced by batch finalization)
- **Automatic batch detection**: 
  - 1 file selected: No batch initialization, normal processing with individual Google Drive upload
  - 2+ files selected: Batch initialization, parallel processing, batch finalization with combined upload

## How It Works

### Single File Processing (1 file selected)
1. User selects one PDF file
2. Frontend sends file to `/api/process-enhanced` WITHOUT batch_id
3. Backend processes file normally:
   - Cleans, splits, extracts, organizes, compresses
   - Uploads to Google Drive individually
   - Returns results with Google Drive link
4. Frontend displays individual results and Google Drive link

### Multi-File Processing (2+ files selected)
1. User selects multiple PDF files
2. Frontend calls `/api/init-batch` to get batch_id
3. Frontend processes all files in parallel:
   - Each file sent to `/api/process-enhanced` WITH batch_id
   - Backend skips individual Google Drive uploads
4. After all files complete, frontend calls `/api/finalize-batch`
5. Backend finalizes batch:
   - Creates combined `all_extractions.json`
   - Creates master archive with all files
   - Single Google Drive upload with all quarters combined
6. Frontend displays:
   - Individual file results (without Google Drive links)
   - Combined batch results with master Google Drive link

## Key Benefits
1. **Automatic detection** - No need to manually choose single vs multi-file mode
2. **Efficient processing** - Multi-file uploads to Google Drive only once
3. **Better organization** - Multi-file creates combined extractions and organized folder structure
4. **Backwards compatible** - Single file processing works exactly as before

## Testing
Use the provided test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd /Users/josephkerolos/smart-document-processor/backend
python3 test_batch_processing.py
```

This will test both single-file and multi-file processing scenarios and verify Google Drive uploads work correctly in each case.
